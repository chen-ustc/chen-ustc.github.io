# Me

I’m a student with broad interests. I wrote this paragraph in English since I think it’s not proper to destroy the origin style built by Mr liu. I didn’t take advantage of English actually. However, maybe this gonna be a chance to improve my skills. I will push posts in English sometimes as practices. Let’s struggle forward together.

# This Site

This site is served on $github.io$. I am using github desktop to post my blogs. It might be the easiest way to build a personal website. So learning to build a cloud server with aliyunESC and framework with hexo(tried it before but failed for some reason still unknown), jekyll, wordpress, all of these are on the schedule.

This site is mainly used to post blogs about:

1. installation of software
2. notes
3. solutions of specific problems
4. diaries
